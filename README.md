# Bundler
Browse application info.

## Note
This is really for jailbreak tweak developers only; the average user won't have a use for this.

Uses `LNApplicationProxy`, `LNBundleProxy` from CoreServies.framework (MobileCoreServices pre-iOS 14.)

Made with SwiftUI, iOS 14+ only.

## Acknowledgements
Uses code derived from [libhooker-configurator](https://github.com/coolstar/libhooker-configurator) and [AppExplorer](https://github.com/joncardasis/AppExplorer)
